OVERVIEW
The Date Night project was designed to fulfil the requirements of Codecademy's CS 101:Intro to Programming portfolio project: Python Terminal Game. The project asked students to "research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program of your choice for your friends and family to play with." Specifically, the instructions included:
  1. Build a terminal program using Python
  2. Add at least one interactive feature using input()
  3. Use Git version control
  4. Use the command line and file navigation

For this project, I decided to create a "game" to help solve the age old problem of having no idea what to do for date night. Inspired by a story performed on The Moth podcast, the game allows users to input ideas for date nights, or to generate a random idea for what to do on their next night out. Ideas can either be general, or location specific. As my friend group is largely split over 3 main geographical areas, the program currently reflects those three locations: Washington, DC; Ithaca, NY; and Rochester, NY.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The program is written in Python, and was created using Vistual Studio (VS) Code. In it's current itteration, the program can only be run in a terminal, using either a code editor or command prompt. 

To run the program, download datenight.py and IdeasList files. Open datenight.py in a code editor or command prompt to use.
